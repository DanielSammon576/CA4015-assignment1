    "The main idea behind the Iowa Gambling Task is test participants decision making using four cards. The participants taking part in the game have a choice of four cards (A,B,C,D) depending on the card choosen and chance the participants can gain or lose money. Each deck has a different probability of winning/losing. This means that there is one deck either {A,B,C,D} that is more favourable to the participants than the others. The idea behind the game is that depending on how one plays the game allows the observer to figure out psychological attributes that they might have."

    "For the purpose of this assignment I will be focusing mainly on the k-means clustering technique. K-means aims at partitioning x abservations into y clusters where each cluster is calculated based on a common mean. I will also run the elbow method of the dataset. The elbow method runs k-means clustering on the dataset for a range of values (say from 1-10) and then for each value of k computes an average score for all clusters. This then basically tells us what the optimum amount of clusters."
