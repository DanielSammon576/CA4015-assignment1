# **Data Analysis**

#### Introduction to Data
The data set at hand is divided into three different trials 95-trial, 100-trial and a 150-trial. There is three seperate csv files per trial. Let's take the 95-trial we have a csv file that records the participants choices, a csv file that records the participants losses and a csv file that records the participants winnings.

As all of the data isn't gathered from one study it is in fact gathered from 10 seperate studies we are also given a fourth csv file which maps what study each participant took part in.

The studies differ in many ways from the size of the actual trials to the age demographics of the studies.

#### Is there a difference between younger/older mean population?
For my research I am going to take a deeper look at the clustering between two studies, the studies differ in one main way in that the mean ages of the two studies are X and X respectively.
